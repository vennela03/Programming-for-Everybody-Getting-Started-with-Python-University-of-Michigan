#3.3 Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
Score Grade
>= 0.9 A
>= 0.8 B
>= 0.7 C
>= 0.6 D
< 0.6 F
If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit. For the test, enter a score of 0.85.

try:
    score = input("Enter Score: ")
    scr = float(score)
except:
    if scr > 1.0 or scr < 0.0:
        print("Error, the score should be in range")
    quit()
    
if scr >=0.9:
    print ("A")
elif scr >=0.8:
    print ("B")
elif scr >=0.7:
    print ("C")
elif scr <0.6:
    print ("F")
